# Minecraft's Arachnophobia

A simple Minecraft Datapack that allows players with arachnophobia to play Minecraft without having to encounter spiders.

## Installation

The installation process is quite simple:

1. Download `arachnophobia.zip`.
1. Go to `datapacks` folder of the world you want to play in.
    - If you are creating a new world go to `[More] > [Data Packs] > [Open Pack Folder]`.
    - If you have already created the world, on world selector screen go to `[Edit] > [Open world folder] > /datapacks`.
1. Copy `arachnophobia.zip` on `datapacks` folder.

## Usage

Currently, the only way to activate Arachnophobia is by adding to a player the "arachnophobic" tag, this can be done through prompt with `/function arachnophobia:config` or manually with `/tag (player) add arachnophobic`. As both options require Command Execution, the Datapack can't be applied to worlds that don't allow it.

## Other features

As players may not encounter spiders, it would be harder to get string, so I added a recipe that turns wool into string.
